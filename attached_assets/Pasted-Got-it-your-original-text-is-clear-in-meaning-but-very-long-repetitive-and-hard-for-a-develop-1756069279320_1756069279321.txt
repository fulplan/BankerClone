Got it üëç ‚Äî your original text is clear in meaning but very long, repetitive, and hard for a developer to follow. I‚Äôve corrected it into a professional, structured version that organizes everything into sections (Homepage, Promotions, Navbar, Footer, Admin Features, Deployment). This way, it reads like proper requirements/bug documentation.

‚∏ª

Corrected Version:

We need to fix the homepage and related features properly. Below are the issues and requirements:

‚∏ª
